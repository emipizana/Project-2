# Project-2
The purpose of this project is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. In this case the prediction will be a binary variable that indicates if the passenger survived. 

## Methods Used
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning
* Logistic Regression

## Project Description
The data has been taken from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). The first thing was to get some insight of the data, the structure and missing values. Next thing was to clean the data and get a deeper understanding of the data. Finally I used two models, a logistic regression and a random forest, and used the random forest, which was more accurate, to do the predictions.
